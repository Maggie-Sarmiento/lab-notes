    <h2>Sobre nosotros</h2>
    <p>Somos una applicaci√≥n dedicada al uso de notas Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of <br />
    the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br />
    text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it <br />
    to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap <br />
    into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <br />
    1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently <br />
    with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
